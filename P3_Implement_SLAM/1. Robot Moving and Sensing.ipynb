    "# Robot Class\n",

    "In this project, we'll be localizing a robot in a 2D grid world. The basis for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is to gather information from a robot's sensors and motions over time, and then use information about measurements and motion to re-construct a map of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've learned, robot motion and sensors have some uncertainty associated with them. For example, imagine a car driving up hill and down hill; the speedometer reading will likely overestimate the speed of the car going up hill and underestimate the speed of the car going down hill because it cannot perfectly account for gravity. Similarly, we cannot perfectly predict the *motion* of a robot. A robot is likely to slightly overshoot or undershoot a target location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at the `robot` class that is *partially* given to you for the upcoming SLAM notebook. First, we'll create a robot and move it around a 2D grid world. Then, **you'll be tasked with defining a `sense` function for this robot that allows it to sense landmarks in a given world**! It's important that you understand how this robot moves, senses, and how it keeps track of different landmarks that it sees in a 2D grid world, so that you can work with it's movement and sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start analyzing robot motion, let's load in our resources and define the `robot` class. You can see that this class initializes the robot's position and adds measures of uncertainty for motion. You'll also see a `sense()` function which is not yet implemented, and you will learn more about that later in this notebook."
