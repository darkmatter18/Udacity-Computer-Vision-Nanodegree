    "## Analyzing The Dot Product Equation\n",
    "At the time I'm writing this, the wikipedia article on the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) begins with a section called **Algebraic Definition**, which starts like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dot product of two vectors $\\mathbf{a} = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$ and $\\mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n]$ is defined as: \n",
    "> \n",
    "> $$\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}b_{i}=a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+\\cdots +a_{n}b_{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know what to look for, this can be pretty unhelfpul. Let's take a look at three features of this equation which can be helpful to understand...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature 1 - Lowercase vs uppercase variables\n",
    "This equation only uses lowercase variables. In general, lowercase variables are used when discussing **vectors** or **scalars** (regular numbers like 3, -2.5, etc...) while UPPERCASE variables are reserved for matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature 2 - Bold vs regular typeface for variables\n",
    "A variable in **bold** typeface indicates a vector or a matrix. A variable in regular typeface is a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature 3 - \"...\" in equations\n",
    "When you see three dots $\\ldots$ in an equation it means \"this pattern could continue any number of times\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EXAMPLE 1 - APPLYING FEATURES 1, 2, and 3\n",
    "When you see something like $\\mathbf{a} = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$ you can infer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **$\\mathbf{a}$ is a vector**: since a is bold it's either a vector OR a matrix, but since it's also lowercase, we know it can only be a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **$\\mathbf{a}$ can have any length**: since there's a $\\ldots$ in the definition for $\\mathbf{a}$, we know that in addition to $a_1$ and $a_2$ there could also be $a_3$, $a_4$, and so on... \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The values in the $\\mathbf{a}$ vector are scalars**: since $a_1$ is lowercase and non-bold we know that it must be a scalar (regular number) as opposed to being a vector or matrix."

    "### Feature 4 - $\\Sigma$ Notation\n",

    "\n",
    "**When you see a $\\Sigma$ you should think \"for loop!\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the dot product, the sigma instructs us to sum $a_ib_i$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. And in this case $n$ is just the length of the $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ vectors.\n",
